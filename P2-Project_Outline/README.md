# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Food Truck Finder is a website (ideally, a mobile app) that allows users to find locations of food trucks near them. As 
food trucks are not tied to permanent locations, they don't hold the same prominence as a restaurant, but offer a unique 
dining experience. A website/app would allow users to find food trucks nearby when they're around for various events or 
as part of the food truck's regular schedule.

The idea came from food trucks being unique places to enjoy food, but not having any sense of regularity. When I've seen 
20+ food trucks lined up at festivals and other events, it made me wonder where they're stationed at outside of those 
special occasions.

### Features
User (customer) login: Users will be able to create accounts and log into the application. Each user can save their 
information to their profile page, as well as add Food Trucks to a list of favorites for quick and easy access.

User (food truck operator) login: Food Truck operators will be able to register as a business account, allowing them a public profile 
page and to display when and where they'll be serving food.

Search: Users will be able to search for food trucks in their area by location and other parameters.

Notifications (maybe?): Ideally, food truck operators would be able to send out a notification when they start serving. This 
works more as a mobile app than a website, but is a possibility in email form as a proof of concept. Users who opt in 
would receive this notification if the Food Truck is saved to their favorites and/or if they're within a X mile range.

### Technologies
* Java
* IntelliJ
* MAMP
* Google Maps API



### What I'll Have to Learn
* GPS/Google Maps integration (API?)
* Potentially might be blurring the line between web and mobile app - going to spend some time researching on languages 
and seeing if I can get a better sense of course of direction with this.
* Notifications from a web app
* I'm sure there's more - I'll probably come back and keep adding to this as I go through the project.
